## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within **Railgun**, please do **NOT** create a public GitHub issue.

Instead, please report it via private contact (e.g., email or Discord DM to the maintainers) if available, or create a strictly private issue if the platform supports it.

We will attempt to address credible vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
